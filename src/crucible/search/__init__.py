"""Search strategies — the project's actual IP.

All strategies satisfy the `SearchStrategy` port and consume the same policy +
verifier, so they are interchangeable from the runner's point of view. M0 ships
`pass1` (the verifier-free single-sample baseline); best-of-N, beam, and MCTS arrive
in later milestones (ROADMAP M2/M4/M6).
