# Crucible

> A verifier-guided reasoning engine: generate many reasoning traces from a small
> open model, score them with a verifier (programmatic checker or a process-reward
> model), and **search** — best-of-N → beam → MCTS over reasoning steps — to turn
> test-time compute into measurable accuracy on math and code.

Most people only *consume* reasoning models; Crucible builds the machinery underneath
and **measures the lift** — accuracy as a function of test-time compute over a small
open policy model. The full design and rationale live in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

**Status:** **The roadmap is built (M0–M7) and the real lift curves are captured — 3-seed
MATH-500, honest numbers.** On real **MATH-500** (3 seeds) with a frozen 1.5B policy (Ollama)
+ a real 1.5B PRM (Skywork, GPU), search lifts **pass@1 38% → 70% (oracle) at N=8**, and on
identical samples the **learned PRM beats self-consistency majority at every N** (N=4: 53% vs
45%) — with the honest caveats counted: the PRM's ~2× compute makes it roughly a wash with
majority at matched *tokens*, and a **7B baseline (67.5% pass@1) is more compute-efficient
than 1.5B + search** (small-beats-big does *not* hold on this stack). Real **beam** and
**MCTS** cells run on the hardest subset and are honestly the most expensive / not winning
here. The full story: [docs/RESULTS.md §0](docs/RESULTS.md) — every number reproduces offline
from committed cassettes. Behind one policy/verifier/search interface: **best-of-N** (M2),
**PRM-weighted selection + the selection gap** (M3), **PRM-guided beam/DVTS** (M4), a
sandboxed **code track** (M5), **MCTS over reasoning steps** (M6), the **compute-optimal
report** (M7), plus review-driven hardening (H1 MATH-500 curve ✓, H3 cassettes ✓, H4
adversarial fixes ✓). See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## Run it

**Prerequisites:** Python ≥ 3.11 (check: `python --version`). No GPU or network needed
for the M0 demo; real model backends (Ollama, etc.) come in from M1.

> **Naming:** the project is **Crucible**, distributed on PyPI as **`crucible-ttc`**
> (ttc = test-time compute), imported as `crucible`, and invoked as `crucible` on the
> command line (`pip install crucible-ttc` once published; the commands below install
> from source).

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Offline demo — generate, verify, and report pass@1 on the bundled sample set:
python -m crucible run --method pass1 --dataset sample --policy mock
```

You should see a per-problem table and a **66.7% (4/6)** pass@1 with a Wilson
confidence interval, and a run record written under `runs/`.

**Real model runs (M1):** install the dataset extra, start [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
and pull a small instruct model, then run real pass@1 on GSM8K:

```powershell
pip install -e ".[datasets]"
ollama pull qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct           # the captured runs' policy model
python -m crucible run --method pass1 --dataset gsm8k --policy ollama `
    --model qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct --limit 20
```

**The real lift curve (H1/H3):** capture it once on a GPU, regenerate it offline forever.
`bench record` samples N×/problem and scores each with the outcome verifier + PRM into a
cassette; `bench curve` computes accuracy-vs-compute for every N/selector from the cassette
(no GPU). Chunk long captures with `--offset`/`--limit` (a crash saves progress and prints
the resume offset), `merge` the chunks, and pool seeds by passing several cassettes:

```powershell
# One line per seed (needs the prm+datasets extras, Ollama, and a GPU):
crucible bench record --dataset math500 --model qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct `
    --prm Skywork/Skywork-o1-Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B --max-n 8 --limit 40 --seed 0 --out runs/m500-s0.json
crucible bench curve runs/m500-s0.json runs/m500-s1.json runs/m500-s2.json   # pooled curve, offline

# Reproduce the committed headline with no GPU:
crucible bench curve tests/fixtures/math500-bestofn-seed*.json
```

**The offline lift-curve demo (M2):** the synthetic-policy curve, no model needed:

```powershell
python -m crucible sweep configs/sample-sweep.yaml   # writes runs/sweep-*/curve.png
```

**The PRM selection gap (M3):** compare majority / PRM / oracle selection on the *same*
best-of-N samples (offline, mock PRM):

```powershell
python -m crucible compare   # writes runs/compare-*/comparison.png (oracle >= prm >= majority)
```

**The full search ladder at matched compute (M4/M6):** pass1 vs best-of-N vs beam vs
MCTS on a synthetic stepwise task, offline:

```powershell
python -m crucible sweep configs/beam-sweep.yaml   # one curve, all four methods
```

**The headline report (M7):** the multi-seed ladder with Wilson CIs + the compute-optimal
frontier; interpreted in [docs/RESULTS.md](docs/RESULTS.md):

```powershell
python -m crucible sweep configs/results.yaml   # 3 seeds; curve.png has the dashed frontier
```

**The code track (M5):** execute model-generated code against unit tests in a
locked-down sandbox. Execution is **off by default** — pass `--allow-code-exec`:

```powershell
python -m crucible run --dataset code-sample --policy mock --allow-code-exec   # 2/3
```

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `crucible run [...]` | Run one experiment (method × dataset × backend) and report it |
| `crucible report <run_dir>` | Print the metrics from a past run |
| `crucible sweep <config.yaml>` | Grid → the accuracy-vs-compute curve (M2) |
| `crucible bench record/merge/curve` | Capture a real lift curve once (sample N×/problem, score offline), pool seeds, overlay beam/MCTS runs — the headline artifact (H1/H3) |
| `crucible compare` | Majority/PRM/oracle on the same samples → the selection gap (M3) |
| `crucible run --dataset code-sample --allow-code-exec` | Code track: sandboxed execution (M5) |
| `crucible run … --record <path>` | Record a live run to a cassette that replays offline in CI (H3) |
| `crucible version` | Print the version |
| `ruff check .` · `mypy src` · `pytest` | Lint · typecheck · tests |

`crucible` and `python -m crucible` are equivalent. Optional extras install per
milestone: `".[datasets]"` (M1), `".[prm]"` (M3), `".[vllm]"`.

## How to give feedback

When reporting an issue or a run:

- Run the **Test** steps for the current milestone in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
- Describe what happened in plain language; paste any errors verbatim (the single most
  useful thing); include the printed metrics table for a run.
